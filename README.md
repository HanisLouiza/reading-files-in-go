Reading files in Go
-------------------


This repo contains runnable files that accompany the blog post ["Reading
Files in Go"](http://kgrz.io/reading-files-in-go-an-overview.html).

The code style is not representative of idiomatic Go. There is pretty
much no useful error handling.


Usage:


Run each file as `go run <filename>`.
